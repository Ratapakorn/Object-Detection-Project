# Object-Detection-Project
This project implements an object detection system leveraging Gabor filters for texture and edge analysis. The approach enhances feature extraction by applying multi-orientation and multi-scale Gabor filters, improving detection accuracy in complex images. Ideal for computer vision applications requiring robust texture-based object recognition.
