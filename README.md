# Object Detection with Gabor Filter

This repository contains an implementation of an object detection system that utilizes **Gabor filters** for enhanced feature extraction. Gabor filters are applied at multiple orientations and scales to capture texture and edge information, which improves the accuracy and robustness of detecting objects in images.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Python / MATLAB / (or your language)** â€” for implementing the filtering and detection algorithms  
- **OpenCV** â€” for image processing and handling  
- **NumPy / SciPy** â€” for numerical operations and filter generation
